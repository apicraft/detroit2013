## Notes

* Kevin asserts that grits are better for the human soul than oatmeal.
* Brian agrees.
* Matt claims that grits are the start of what will become a real-life Soylent Green.
* Alan makes a case for both grits and oatmeal co-existing.
* Brian asserts that grits are a local favorite and should therefore be celebrated.
* Matt concedes, begrudgingly.
* Outcome: Grits are great and fit most people's breakfast needs.  However, we recognize some regional preference for oatmeal and humbly respect historical ties.  We should be accepting of all breakfast items today but start to move to a more grits-friendly environment in the future.
