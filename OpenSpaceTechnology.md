# Open Space Technology

## Glossary

* Opening Session
	* Attendees volunteer topics and place them on the Community Bulletin board in a certain matrix cell defining the place and time.
* Community Bulletin Board
	* A matrix of meeting spaces and time slots.  Attendees will place their sessions on this board at the Opening Session.
* Village Marketplace
	* "Opening the Village Marketplace" refers to letting attendees sign up for sessions after the Opening Session.  Sessions can be moved or merged as necessary.
* Morning Announcements
	* An opportunity to announce changes in meetings (additions, cancellations, and mergers).
* Evening News
	* Similar to Morning Announcements, except we also reflect on the day and discuss experiences.  (Both Morning Announcements and Evening News are an excuse to group together.  This is important.)
* Proceedings
	* A record of the sessions.
	* THE FORMAT 
		* Title
		* Convener
		* List of participants
		* Discussion and recommendations
* Breaking News
	* Proceedings.  For us, this will be on GitHub.  Proceedings will be printed out and placed on wall.
* Bumblebees
	* Attendees who constantly bounce between sessions.  Great for cross-pollination.
* Butterflies
	* Attendees who don't attach to any session.  They create areas of silence and reflection.  Sometimes great conversations can start between butterflies.

## The Four Principles

1. Whoever comes is the right people.
2. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
3. Whenever it starts, it is the right time.
4. When it's over, it's over.

## The Law of Two Feet
If, during our time together, you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet and go to some more productive place.


## Note for Facilitators

The job of facilitator is to create space and timeâ€¦ and then give it all away.
